### Design Mock-up

![list](pics/mockup.jpg)

- You should use the `background-image` property
- As always, make your webpage pixel-perfect to the reference image
- **ABOUT** and **CONTACT** should have a heavier `font-weight` on `:hover`
- As a bonus, link other pages in the navigation

## Solution:

[indexI.html](html/indexI.html) <br>
[styleI.css](css/styleI.css) <br>

# Background Patterns

Let's create a simple page displaying a quote!
Two patterns surround the quote. The quotes are positioned in a certain way that the ones on the top are mirroring the one at the bottom.

Take a look at the examples:

Take a look into the [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) element and make use of it.

## Solution:

[indexII.html](html/indexII.html) <br>
[styleII.css](css/styleII.css) <br>

# Breaking the flow

**Instructions**

1. Create an empty box with the class of `halloworld`. The box should have a width and height of 200px. Inside the box, add the text "Hallo World" and change the background color to orange.

2. Center the `halloword` box in the middle of the screen.

3. Move the `halloworld` box 5 pixels to the left and 7 pixels down from the center position.
   **Hint**: For centering elements in HTML try using the margin property.

4. Add another square box with the class of `box1`. The box should have a width and height of 200px and a red background color. Position the box at the bottom-left of the screen.

5. Add another square box with the class of `box2`. The box should have a background color of rgb(0, 255, 85) and a height and width of 200px. This box should be positioned at the bottom-left of the screen, but should be 10px higher and 10px more to the right than `box1`.

6. Add a third box with a class of `box3`. It should have a background color of rgb(0, 183, 255). It should be positioned at the bottom-left of the window, but should be 10px higher and 10px further right than `box2`.
