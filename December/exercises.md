### Design Mock-up

![list](pics/mockup.jpg)

- You should use the `background-image` property
- As always, make your webpage pixel-perfect to the reference image
- **ABOUT** and **CONTACT** should have a heavier `font-weight` on `:hover`
- As a bonus, link other pages in the navigation

## Solution:

[indexI.html](html/indexI.html) <br>

# Background Patterns

Let's create a simple page displaying a quote!
Two patterns surround the quote. The quotes are positioned in a certain way that the ones on the top are mirroring the one at the bottom.

Take a look at the examples:

# Breaking the flow

**Instructions**

1. Create an empty box with the class of `halloworld`. The box should have a width and height of 200px. Inside the box, add the text "Hallo World" and change the background color to orange.

2. Center the `halloword` box in the middle of the screen.

3. Move the `halloworld` box 5 pixels to the left and 7 pixels down from the center position.
   **Hint**: For centering elements in HTML try using the margin property.

4. Add another square box with the class of `box1`. The box should have a width and height of 200px and a red background color. Position the box at the bottom-left of the screen.

5. Add another square box with the class of `box2`. The box should have a background color of rgb(0, 255, 85) and a height and width of 200px. This box should be positioned at the bottom-left of the screen, but should be 10px higher and 10px more to the right than `box1`.

6. Add a third box with a class of `box3`. It should have a background color of rgb(0, 183, 255). It should be positioned at the bottom-left of the window, but should be 10px higher and 10px further right than `box2`.

# UI-Basics Test: First Test

## General Instructions

- Work from the `index.html` file and a CSS stylesheet.

- You can use google, but you cannot ask your teacher/s or your classmates for help.

- Good luck!

## Test Instructions

### Starting Up

- Make and link a CSS stylesheet and work from there.

- Use positioning to fix the header to the top of the page. It should take up 100% of the available space and not cover any of the content below. Give the header a background color of **cyan**.

### Content Styling

- In the "_List_" section, change the color of the second list item to blue.

- In the "_Images_" section, make all of the images appear side-by-side.

- Give three `h3` elements in the html document the same class.

- Change the color of the `h3` elements to orange using rbg. The size of the text should be `2em` and appear as uppercase.

- Select all descendant links in the footer. Change the links' color to green on `visited` and red on `hover`.

### Box Model

- In the "_Box Model_" section, add `5 pixels` of `padding` to the section element that contains a paragraph and an image.

- In the "_Box Model_" section, make sure the margins of the section element which contains a paragraph and an image is `10%` of its parent's width.

### Images & Links

- In the "_Link_" section, insert a link that redirects the user to an image of your favourite book cover. Make sure that the image opens in a new tab.

- In the "_Images_" section, add the image `tree.jpg` from the image folder. Make the image appear rounded. Add [this](https://caseytrees.org/tree-species/) link to the `tree.jpg` image.

### Hierarchy

- Move the footer in HTML to the bottom of the document.

## Solution:

[indexIV.html](html/indexIV.html) <br>
[styleIV.css](css/styleIV.css) <br>
