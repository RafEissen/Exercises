        The Free and Hanseatic City (Freie und Hansestadt) of Hamburg is the
        second smallest of the 16 Länder of Germany, with a territory of only
        292 square miles (755 square km). It is also the most populous city in
        Germany after Berlin and has one of the largest and busiest ports in
        Europe. The official name, which covers both the Land and the town,
        reflects Hamburg’s long tradition of particularism and self-government.
        Hamburg and Bremen (the smallest of the Länder) are, in fact, the only
        German city-states that still keep something of their medieval
        independence. The characteristic individuality of Hamburg has been
        proudly maintained by its people so that, in many spheres of public and
        private life, the city’s culture has retained its uniqueness and has not
        succumbed to the general trend of standardization.
