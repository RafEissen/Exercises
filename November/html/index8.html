    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div id="first_div">
      <h5 id="first_h5">For the cake</h5>
      <ul id="first_ul">
        <li>70g softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>120g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>140g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>finely grated zest 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon curd</li>
        <li>2 tbsp full-fat milk</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>For the drizzle topping</h5>

      <ul id="second_ul">
        <li>30g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>juice 1 lemon</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>For the feather icing</h5>

      <ul id="third_ul">
        <li>250g icing sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp water</li>
        <li>splash of yellow food colouring</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ul id="last_ul">
      <li>
        Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin
        with baking parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together until pale,
        light and fluffy. Add the eggs and mix again. Add the flour, baking
        powder, lemon zest, lemon curd and milk, and mix with a wooden spoon
        until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Pour the mixture into
        the prepared tin and bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer comes out
        clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the sugar and lemon juice together and pour over the hot cake. Leave
        to cool in the tin. You can eat the cake as it is, or for a fancy
        finish, try making this feather icing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the icing sugar with just enough water to give a runny, but not
        watery, icing. Put a small amount of icing in a separate bowl. Add a few
        drops of the food colouring to the icing until pale yellow. Spoon into a
        disposable icing bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cake from the tin and peel off the baking parchment. Sit the
        cake on a wire rack over a baking tray. Spread the white icing over the
        top. Pipe thin lines of the coloured icing across the width of the cake.
        Use a cocktail stick to drag through the lines in opposite directions to
        create a feathered effect. Leave to set before cutting into slices.
      </li>
    </ul>
