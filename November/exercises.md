# GitHub Classroom Test Exercise (12.11.2020)

Let's do a little exercise to practice the GitHub Classroom workflow. The task itself is not meant to be challenging. :wink:

## Workflow Steps

1. **Clone** your personal exercise repository.
2. Inside, switch to a **working branch** (e.g., `solution`) where you will solve the exercise.
3. Work on the task...
4. When you are done, push your solution branch to GitHub.
5. On GitHub, create a **pull request** and assign me as a reviewer.
6. I will review you pull request and, if required, add some comments.
7. If you solved the exercise, I will accept the pull request and merge into master.
8. If there are any problems, I will request changes and add some notes.
9. After a while, I will give you a link where you can inspect the official solution.
10. We can discuss challenging exercises during the next recap.

## Test Task

1. Create a `solution.md` markdown file, and add the title of your favorite scifi book, movie, or TV show, together with a cover image.
