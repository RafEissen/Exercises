# GitHub Classroom Test Exercise (12.11.2020)

Let's do a little exercise to practice the GitHub Classroom workflow. The task itself is not meant to be challenging. :wink:

## Workflow Steps

1. **Clone** your personal exercise repository.
2. Inside, switch to a **working branch** (e.g., `solution`) where you will solve the exercise.
3. Work on the task...
4. When you are done, push your solution branch to GitHub.
5. On GitHub, create a **pull request** and assign me as a reviewer.
6. I will review you pull request and, if required, add some comments.
7. If you solved the exercise, I will accept the pull request and merge into master.
8. If there are any problems, I will request changes and add some notes.
9. After a while, I will give you a link where you can inspect the official solution.
10. We can discuss challenging exercises during the next recap.

## Test Task

1. Create a `solution.md` markdown file, and add the title of your favorite scifi book, movie, or TV show, together with a cover image.

# Boilerplate (and Then Some) (16.11.2020)

## Instructions

- Create an HTML file.
- Just this once, please **don't** use Emmet.
- In the file, declare the document type and add the root element.
- Nested in the root element, add a head element and a body element.
- In the head element, create a meta tag for charset and author. Add your name to the author tag.
- Add a title in the meta tag and give your document a title.
- In the body, add a heading and two paragraphs.
- Comment out the second paragraph so it won't be displayed in the browser.

Please use our GitHub Classroom workflow: working branch => pull request

## Solution

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <title>This is title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is heading</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <!-- <p>This is also a paragraph</p> -->

  </body>
